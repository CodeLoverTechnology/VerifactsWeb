            <p>Criminal Verification – Police Verification</p><br />

            <p><strong>What –</strong> Police Verification provides information on any FIRs lodged against the subject at the local police station.</p><br />

            <p><strong>Why –</strong> Police Verification is a very sensitive check and is today considered to be an important form of criminal verification for Industries like Guarding, Transportation and Education etc. With the increasing number of crimes, Employers are taking up Police Verification for all employees holding sensitive positions. Employees with criminal records pose a threat to other employees, company’s reputation and assets.</p><br />

            <p><strong>How –</strong> Our Special Investigation Team would visit the Police Department to obtain the information on the criminal antecedents of the individual.</p><br />

            
            <p>Criminal Verification – Court Record Check</p><br />

            <p><strong>What –</strong> Court Record Check is done to check if there is any court case against the said candidate in the local court of the given jurisdiction, High Court & the Supreme Court.</p><br />

            <p><strong>Why –</strong> With the number of defaulters and the rate of frauds on the rise, foolproof employee verification is not complete without a court records check. Court Record check dig up records of illegal activities that prospective employees might have indulged in, as well as of criminal or civil offences which have led to litigation. By carrying out court record checks at pre-employment stage, you put a ‘No Entry’ sign for the wrong type of personnel into your Company.</p><br />
